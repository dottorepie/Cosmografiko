  Cosmographic universe is a generative algorithmic additive synthesis SynthDef architecture conceptualizeing an animatronic and auditory timeline of the cosmos,
utilizing harmonics, sound art, controled randomness, music theory, spatial sound and quaternions. The ,abstract harmonic astronomy, generative synth can be used as standalone envelopes in quad, 
cubic or 12 channel sound installations (VBAP),or as a drone with parallel Midiout via AM/FM with the addition of external synths.

Complete description on the synthesis, coding structure, musical composition and use of this library can be found on the pdf doucemnt and thesis 'Cosmpgraphiko_SuperCollider manual' on the main directory 

//
The conceptual framework of the composition is a Kepler Mysterium Cosmagraphic auditory and partly visual in computer generative graphics.
Pairing with doku aesthetic video visual content is conceptually an itnerest, as well as an adventure space navigation game via Unreal engine.
The concept is modernized in atempt as influenced are of contemporary media theory and open source mathematic and science.
//main aesthetic and conceptual framework of this sound installation is to showcase and make immersive and tangible, not only a music of the spheres, but also the fact
that the univerese no matter how unimaginably vast is measureable and its fuel consciousness. If we accept that and scientifiaclly prove it, something only possible through mathematics,
then we can only speculate how the previous one was or how the next one might be. There is no afterlife there is no reencarnation there is no excuse such as 'god' there is only one
cosmos 'the best possible one, under sufficient reason'.
